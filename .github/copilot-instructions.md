## Code guidelines
- Make sure the code works on MacOS and Debian/Ubuntu.
- Use standard tools available in package managers like Homebrew and apt.
- Use `bash` for scripting.
- Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang for portability.
- Use `set -euo pipefail` to ensure the script exits on errors and undefined variables.
